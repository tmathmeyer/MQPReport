\section{User Guide}
\textit{Checksims} is a tool for detecting source code similarities in an
arbitrary number of user-provided programming projects. Its primary purpose is
to flag potential cases of academic dishonesty in programming assignments.
\textit{Checksims} is not intended to detect academic dishonesty on its own,
but rather to act as a tool to identify suspicious assignments for review by
course staff.

The \textit{Checksims} user interface was designed to allow course staff to
use \textit{Checksims} without havving to memorize command line arguments.

\subsection{Installing Checksims}
\textit{Checksims} is distributed as an executable Java package (\texttt{.jar}
file). As a Java application, \textit{Checksims} is cross-platform and should
run on any system capable of running a Java virtual machine (JVM). The
provided Jar file is completely self-contained and requires no installation,
and should be named as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\texttt{checksims-\checksimsver-jar-with-dependencies.jar}
\end{figure}


Note that \checksimsver~represents the current version of \textit{Checksims}
at the time of this writing, and may be different for the version you receive.

Note that \textit{Checksims} requires a Java 8 virtual machine. The
latest version of the Oracle JVM is recommended, and can be found at the
following URL:

\end{figure}

A 64-bit processor and JVM are strongly recommended.  Some \textit{Checksims}
detectors can consume a substantial amount of memory, potentially more than the
4GB maximum available to a 32-bit JVM\@. A 64-bit JVM can prevent a number of
memory-related program crashes.


\subsection{Running Checksims}

\subsubsection{Window and OSX}
Both Windows and OSX have the ability to run \textit{.jar} files when they are
double clicked on. It is recommended to put the \textit{Checksims} executable
in either the folder where assignments are kept, or on the desktop for easy
access.

\subsubsection{Linux / Advanced Usage}
While some graphical environments for the linux based operating system have the
ability to run \textit{.jar} files through a double click, the recommended way
of running \textit{Checksims} is through a shell. To run a \textit{.jar} file
from the command line, use the following command:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \texttt{java -jar PATH/TO/CHECKSIMS\_JAR.jar}
\end{figure}

This command can be put inside of a shell script for more convenient use.

\subsection{Intacting with the Interface}
When \textit{Checksims} runs, the user will be presented with a reletively small window
bearing the \textit{Checksims} logo, shown below:
