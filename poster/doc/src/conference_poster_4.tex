\headerbox{Abstract}{name=abstract, column=0, row=0, span=1}{
  In order to improve the quality and usability of the Checksims software
  similarity detection tool, we present a series of modifications to the
  original project; changes include Syntax Tree comparison algorithms, integration
  with existing grading software, user interface improvements,
  and the ability to perform comparison against historical data.

\headerbox{Background}{name=background, column=0, row=0.23, span=1}{
  Academic dishonesty is often poorly defined. Different institutions,
  departments, professors, and courses have differing definitions and
  interpretations. \textit{Checksims} concerns itself with detecting instances
  of potential `unauthorized copying', similar sections of code that may
  constitute academic dishonesty.
  Detecting similar sections of code is done in a number of ways. The two
  primary types of detection are token based comparison, or finding similar
  sections in a string of `tokens' representing the source file, and AST based
  comparison methods, finding similar sections of the `Abstract Syntax Tree'
  of a source file. Previous work has indicated that AST based methods are
  often more robust than token based methods, but come with their own set of
  limitations.
}

\headerbox{Objectives}{name=objectives, column=0, row=0.620, span=1}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Design and implement an AST similarity detection algorithm, and then
    compare it to the Smith-Waterman in both accuracy and performance.
  \item Design a format and archiving system for comparing submissions not only
    to one another, but to previous course submissions as well.
  \item Integrate \textit{Checksims} with \textit{turnin}, the most commonly
    used tool for computer science assignment submissions at WPI\@.
  \item Create a graphical user interface for \textit{Checksims}, as currently
    it requires use of a command line interface.
  \end{itemize}

\headerbox{Approach}{name=process, column=1, row=0.0, span=1}{
  \textit{Checksims'} existing token-based document representation was
  supplemented with a language independent AST based representation. The
  \textit{ANTLR} parser generation tool and existing grammars were used to
  generate parsers for the C, C++, Python, and Java languages. AST
  representations were compared by first generating a dictionary from heuristic
  fingerprint to AST node in the first document, then by recursively rating node
  similarity in the second document by measuring the number of identical
  subtrees found in the first document.
