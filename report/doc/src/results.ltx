\section{Results --- talk about other corpora!!}
\subsection{Time Complexity}
\subsubsection{Smith-Waterman}
When running \textit{Checksims} with the Smith-Waterman algorithm on corpus 2.b14.2 and machine S1 the
process takes 7 minutes and 36.55 seconds.

\subsubsection{AST Fingerprinting}
Running the AST Fingerprinting algorithm on corpus 2.b14.2 and machine S1 takes 41.78 seconds.

\subsection{Flagged Submissions}
\subsubsection{Smith-Waterman}
On corpus 2.b14.2, Smith-Waterman detected 31 instances of plagerism. Upon manual
inspection, many of these instances involved student 33, who only submitted a
single file with only 78 lines of code, many of which were short and contained
the specific keywords students were instructed to use. The inverse matching value
for 26 of these 31 instances were less than 20 percent, and can be considered
false positives. After these were removed, the pairs still flagged for
similarity are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item students 9 and 45
    \item students 229 and 21
    \item students 195 and 80
    \item students 56 and 148
    \item students 176 and 179
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AST Fingerprinting}
On corpus 2.b14.2, AST Fingerprinting detected 15 instances of plagerism.  On
closer inspection, 4 pairs were found to have a match value and inverse match
value greater than 70 percent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item students 219 and 196
    \item students 191 and 211
    \item students 21 and 229
    \item students 176 and 179
\end{itemize}
As mentioned earlier, AST parsing is impossible for students who submit invalid
code. When running the AST Fingerprinting algorithm on corpus 2.b14.2, the
following submissions were found to have errors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item student 186
    \item student 71
    \item student 65
    \item student 33
    \item student 133
    \item student 9
    \item student 184
    \item student 240
    \item student 59
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparing the methods}
The results of the algorithms show that each caught in some way a similar set
of assignments. AST Fingerprinting missed catching students 195 and 80, and 56
and 158. Smith Waterman missed 219 and 196, and 191 and 211. Upon manual
inspection of these assignments, the following conclusions were made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item students 195 and 80 copied code
    \item students 56 and 158 did not copy code
    \item students 219 and 196 copied code
    \item student 191 and 211 copied code
\end{itemize}
These results were signiifcant because they show that neither algorithm catches
all instances of plagerism, and that the AST Comparison method is credible by
itself, but also in tandem with Smith Waterman.
