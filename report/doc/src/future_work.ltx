\section{Future Work}
\textit{Checksims} is far from finished. In this section, we have outlined
important goals that we think could be worked on by future projects.

\subsection{Language Support}
One of the most obvious improvements that can be made to \textit{Checksims} is
supporting more than four languages. Languages such as Scala, Ruby, or
JavaScript could be supported in future versions.

\subsection{UI Overhaul}
Currently the UI is functional, but not beautiful. We think it is an area where
work on the user experience from an HCI perspective could happen.
